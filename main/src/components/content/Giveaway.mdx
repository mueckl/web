### Introduction
We know that not everyone is able to purchase OsmAnd on Google Play store due to various reasons, but many of you would still like to support the application using it and spreading it around the world. We are proud of our community, so we have decided to give away OsmAnd licenses for free as a reward for your support. The number of promocodes we can provide is limited, so we will choose the winners based on the results of a small game that we have organized to make the whole process more entertaining.

### How it works
- Subscribe to our news letter by providing your email in the Downloads menu of the free OsmAnd version.
- Once a month receive a notification by email to participate in a giveaway campaign.
- For several days every hour 1 promocode is randomly distributed among participants.
- The algorithm runs every hour and picks latest Bitcoin Block hash as a random seed. Bitcoin block hash number is divided by number of participants and the remainder is claimed as a winner.
- All numbers are published here, so everybody can verify process transparency.
- You need to subscribe every month in case you want to participate in the giveaway.
- If you like this idea, please feel free to share it with your social connections :)
